1. Process Management with Daemon Processes
   File: daemon_processes.py
   Description: Demonstrates how to use daemon and non-daemon processes. Daemon processes terminate when the main program exits.

Key Features:

Background and non-background process execution.
Process-specific behaviors. 2. Pipes for Inter-Process Communication
File: pipes_example.py
Description: Uses multiprocessing.Pipe to communicate between processes. A producer creates items, and a consumer multiplies them.

Key Features:

Sending and receiving data via pipes.
Multiple processes interacting through a shared communication channel. 3. Producer-Consumer Model
File: producer_consumer.py
Description: Implements a producer-consumer model using a Queue. The producer adds items to the queue, and the consumer retrieves them.

Key Features:

Synchronization between producer and consumer.
Demonstrates the use of multiprocessing.Queue. 4. Process Lifecycle Management
File: process_lifecycle.py
Description: Explores process lifecycle management, including starting, terminating, and joining processes.

Key Features:

Monitoring process state.
Handling process termination and exit codes. 5. Using Barriers and Locks
File: barriers_and_locks.py
Description: Synchronizes processes using barriers and locks. Ensures processes wait for each other at a barrier point.

Key Features:

Barrier synchronization.
Serialized printing with locks. 6. Process Pools
File: process_pools.py
Description: Demonstrates the use of multiprocessing.Pool to execute a function across multiple input values concurrently.

Key Features:

Efficient parallel processing using pools.
Map functionality for distributing tasks. 7. Custom Process Class
File: custom_process_class.py
Description: Defines a custom process class by extending multiprocessing.Process.

Key Features:

Custom behavior for processes.
Demonstrates the run method in a custom process class. 8. Spawning Multiple Processes
File: spawn_processes.py
Description: Spawns multiple processes to execute a function with different arguments.

Key Features:

Dynamically starting and joining multiple processes.
Demonstrates loop-based process creation.
